  Knowledge and governance closeout: reconcile project docs, rule files
  (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md), authorized agent memory, and workspace residue with
  what the code and runtime actually do, so the next session or the next
  person starts from one current answer. Trigger when the user names
  "neat-freak", "洁癖", or "/neat" — and also on clear knowledge-closeout
  intent without the name: syncing or tidying project docs/rules/memory after
  development ("把文档和记忆整理一下", "收尾时把文档同步掉", "docs 和代码对不上了"),
  stale or conflicting CLAUDE.md/memory, a clean handoff to a teammate or a
  fresh session, or auditing whether workspace rules are actually followed.
  Do not trigger for pure coding/refactoring/debugging tasks, tidying data or
  prose (JSON, 周报, changelog announcements), or a bare "整理" with no
  project-knowledge context.
compatibility: Requires filesystem read access. Writes and destructive actions follow the active agent, workspace, and user authorization rules. Git and rg improve verification; scripts/audit-inventory.sh needs Bash — without it, do the equivalent checks manually. Works on any Agent Skills platform.
